# Kurkkumopo Catcher

Kurkkumopo Catcher is a game where the main objective is to shoot a puck and hit the target (kurkkumopo) with the least distance possible, in a computer-generated map full of obstacles made by contributors! Dominate the leaderboard as each weak the game resets and the best player wins glory and a unique kurkkumopo emblem! The game is in the early stages of development. Check out the roadmap to find things waiting to get built!
